Description: As a project for CS599 Unsupervised Learning, I built this package
             of simple clustering algorithms. These algoirthms will help you
             gain insight into a data set by sorting the data into a
             pre-determined number of clusters. Note, while these algorithms work,
             they are more limited in options and less efficient than those
             algoirthms found in other, more proffessional packages.
